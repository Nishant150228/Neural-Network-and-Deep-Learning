# Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning
This repository contains a collection of basic neural network projects that I have worked on, showcasing foundational concepts and implementations. It includes projects like the Perceptron model, covering both single-output and multi-output configurations, as well as the Adaline (Adaptive Linear Neuron) model.
